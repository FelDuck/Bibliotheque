* Projectile detecting programm
Was part of a larger project but this part ended up getting cut since the videos I took had too much
interference in them. To be fair they did, but I made it work and created a program who could easily
pick out what is a projectile and what is interference using the property of physics that lateral
speed remains constant in the X axis (assuming no air interference).

I wrote every single line of code of this part of the project.
